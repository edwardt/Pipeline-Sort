	Added socket_sendfile, socket_getifidx
	Fixed haven2i.c to work with broken BSD includes

Thu Sep  7 15:35:20 CEST 2000
	Oops, some uint32.h dependencies were missing.
	I didn't notice because I have a copy in /usr/local/include.
	Also, unix.a referenced but did not include error_temp.o.
	Thanks for OHIRA, Shinya for telling me!

Tue Sep  5 19:03:45 CEST 2000
	Added test for if_nameindex.  socket_getifname always returns
	  "[unknown]" if the test failed.
	Added "L" flag to choose.sh like "l" but also meaning
	  "link against `cat $5.lib`, too".  It is meant for socket.lib.
	Added scope_id IPv6 API.  scope_id is zero most of the time, but
	  it specifies the interface for link-local addresses.
	Added socket_getifname to get a string representation for an
	  network interface index or IPv6 scope_id.
	Added a few man pages for socket_* calls (not done yet).

Sun Jul 30 04:47:41 CEST 2000
	changed test from == to -eq (portability)

Thu Jul 13 00:59:16 CEST 2000
	wrote man pages for pathexec, pathexec_run and pathexec_env

Wed Jul 12 01:34:47 CEST 2000
	wrote man pages for uint16* and uint32*
	wrote man pages for scan_* and fmt_*
	imported scan_long and scan_plusminus from mess822
	imported scan_8long from ezmlm
	imported fmt_uint0, fmt_str and fmt_uint from ezmlm
	replaced my fmt_xlong with the djb one from publicfile
	wrote man pages for byte_*
	wrote man pages for ip[46]_scan and ip[46]_fmt
	imported stralloc_starts from ezmlm
	imported fmt_strn from qmail
	wrote timeoutaccept and timeoutaccept6 using iopause
	  (the only djb implementation I found is from publicfile and
	   uses select instead of iopause)
	ip6_fmt now does not write \0 behind the output.
	ip6_fmt no longer writes anything if dest is FMT_LEN.

Sun Jul  2 16:40:08 CEST 2000
